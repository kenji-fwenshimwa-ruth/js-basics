6. differentiate between stastically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of langueges that fall under each category
. A language is statically typed if the type of a variable is known at compile time. For some languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is; other languages (e.g.: Java, C, C++) offer some form of type inference, the capability of the type system to deduce the type of a variable (e.g.: OCaml, Haskell, Scala, Kotlin).
The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the compiler, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.
Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

. Dynamically typed languages
A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time (unless using a statically-typed language with type inference).
Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Erlang

7. Differentiate between the javascript data types 'null' and 'undefined'.
. undefined
It means a variable declared, but no value has been assigned a value.

For example,
var demo;
alert(demo); //shows undefined
alert(typeof demo); //shows undefined

. null
Whereas, null in JavaScript is an assignment value. You can assign it to a variable.

For example,
var demo = null;
alert(demo); //shows null
alert(typeof demo); //shows object
